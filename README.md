- 👋 Hi, I’m @likaiw2  
- 👀 I’m interested in computer vision, deep learning, and quantitative trading. I’ve worked on projects involving medical image segmentation, remote sensing segmentation, and underwater image style transfer.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in PyTorch, reinforcement learning for stock trading (JoinQuant), and multi-modal models.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research projects in photogrammetry, remote sensing, and image understanding, especially those involving segmentation or representation learning.  
- 📫 How to reach me: You can find me on GitHub or email me directly (contact info in resume/website).  
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once deployed a Bilibili trending crawler on a Raspberry Pi just for fun — and it still works!
